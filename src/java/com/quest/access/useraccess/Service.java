/**
 * <p>
 * This file defines a framework for providing services through a server
 * dividing the activities of a server into services splits up the servers
 * work and ensures that the logic of the different services is easily maintained
 * in different class files. When a programmer writes a service class he initializes
 * the service by creating an instance of the service class with the specified details.
 * When the server starts it reads all the services registered for this server into memory
 * and therefore whenever a client requests for any service, the server checks whether the service
 * exists, if it exists the server gets the location of the service class and then invokes the
 * provideService method in the specific service class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Service providing classes must implement the Serviceable interface and provide an
 * implementation for the provideService() method. Services normally have a permanent 
 * privilege associated with them and therefore if a user has access to a service it
 * means he has the corresponding permanent privilege, revoking this privilege from
 * the user renders him unable to access the corresponding service. Every client's request
 * to a service runs in a different thread which invokes the specified service and returns the 
 * result to the client, this means that service classes should be designed with multi threading
 * in mind since different threads may call a service class at the same time
 * </p>
